{% block content_title %}<h2>WE WANT TO DO IT RIGHT.  THE FIRST TIME.</h2>

<div>
	<p>Let's face it- we all know that no one is perfect.  But we strive to be.  If we don't do it right the first time, we want to do what we can to make it right because we know our reputation means everything.</p>
<br>
<br>
	<p>Unlike a lot of other shops, we work on both old and new motorcycles, and have a wide range of experience on all makes and models- from American to import.  Our technicians do not “just work on bikes.”  They love what they do, they all ride or race motorcycles, and are involved with different events and venues. Our technicians have a combined amount of over 71 years experience!  Their mechanical backgrounds vary and include the following specialists: a professional racer, three trained and certified Dyno-jet masters, and a offroad racer who is a KTM fanatic. There aren't many places like us!</p>
<br>
<br> 
	<p>Working on your motorcycle is as important and exciting to them as it to you.   We try to take it past “just doing the service” and talk to our customers, educating them, and hearing what they need and want.  We appreciate the business and customers we service and meet!</p>

	<h3>DYNO TUNING</h3>
	<p>Rick Beggs has been offering state of the art dynamometer performance tuning for over 20 years. A Dynamometer is the best alternative to live road testing which can be done right in our shop. It reduces the time it takes to troubleshoot a bike. A problem that occurs on the road can often be duplicated during a test drive on the dyno.</p><br>
	<p>A baseline run is about $50.  To dynotune a motorcycle, it is UNDER $380 for fuel injected motorcycles and usually more for carburetor equipped  motorcycles.</p><br>
	<p>The method of measuring horsepower is relatively simple. Energy drain from the rear tire is stored in a rotating mass (drum) to simulate the inertia of the motorcycle. A computer connected to the Dynamometer displays horsepower measuring the drum's acceleration.</p><br>
	<p>This allows us to quickly measure, record and diagnose performance problems. You can count on our system to accurately reproduce road or race situations. The service department no longer has to spend hours trying to diagnose problem bikes. Dyno graphs of changes in exhaust pipes, chains, spark plugs, and even oil brands can prove performance and reliability of products.</p>
	<h3>Suspension</h3>
	<p>We do full on rebuilds, tuning of what you have and upgrades, from dirt bikes to road race bikes, we do it all. If  you are riding on the track, ask anybody, suspension is going to make you faster than building your motor.</p><br>
	<p>We carry a great selection of riding apparel to meet your needs, no matter what the weather brings- whether that means keeping you cooler in the summer with ventilated gear, or warm in the fall and winter with our heated grips, gloves, or suits. We even have mil-spec vests for our armed forces customers!</p><br>
	<p>Most of all, among the other helmets we offer, we carry Arai helmets because they are the best, and we want to offer our customers the best for their biggest asset: their head. Arai knows that not all heads are shaped the same either, so by some simple measurements and their wide array of padding, we can fit you with the right size helmet.</p><br>
	<p>Did you know that 8 out of 10 people are wearing the WRONG size helmet?  You might be saying, "So what"?  Well, that could mean the difference between your head safely avoiding serious injury and a concussion- or even worse.  Watch Jay Leno's Garage where Jay explains the Arai difference.</p><br>
	<h3>Oil Changes</h3>
	<p>RnR Cycles uses Amsoil lubricants.  We recommend synthetic oil because it offers better protection to your engine, especially if your bike gets really hot in traffic or you explore the higher end of your rev range often.  Also, you can extend your oil change intervals if need be. Mineral (regular) oil is fine for most motorcycles and it does cost 1/2 the price. If you are on a budget, mineral oil will fit your needs, but if you want to ensure the longest life possible out of your engine, hands down- synthetic oil is the way to go.</p><br>
	<p>Most bikes generally range from the high $80s to around $140.  This price includes parts and labor.  Some bikes take less oil than others, some people prefer running synthetic oil vs regular, and some prefer premium/OEM oil filters vs inexpensive generic filters.</p><br>
	<h3>Tires</h3>
	<p>The cost to change tires can vary significantly based on your motorcycle.  If they are sportbike tires and rims are already OFF the bike, mounting is $25 for each tire.  A straight forward sportbike with rims ON the bike is $50 each.  A motorcycle with inner tubes usually takes twice the time to do a tire change.  A big cruiser often takes more time because extra parts like the exhaust has to be removed or even the suspension.  Sometimes, a bike has some rust at certain bolts that need to be removed in order for a tire change, and sometimes, these bolts break.  These kinds of things are not always forseeable and can add to a projected cost.  We will do our best to give you as accurate of a quote as possible.</p><br>
	<p>Even though we are a brick and mortar shop, our prices on tires are usually competitive with online pricing and most tires can get here in 1-2 business days with free shipping!  Also, if you don't purchase tires from us, know that we are listed as a preffered installer with Motorcycle Superstore.</p><br>
	<h3>Insurance</h3>
	<p>If you need to file an insurance claim, we can help you with your estimate.  We can work with you and your insurance to make sure your bike is meticulously inspected for ALL damage.  If you need towing services, we provide that as well.</p>
